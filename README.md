# Lost in translation React assignment

A react project for the react assignment at Noroff in the fullstack Java course in Experis Academy

In this assignment i have created an app that contains a login page, translation page and a profile page. The user can log in, translate a sentence or word to sign language and the translated text will be stored to the user. In the profile page the user can see the translation history and clear the history. Logout is also in the profile page.
This app uses the local storage to store the user. The api used might reset and remove users and/or translation history.
